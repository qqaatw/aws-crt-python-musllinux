# aws-crt-python-musllinux

Currently the official [awscrt](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-python/) doesn't provide binary wheels for musllinux like Alpine, this repository builds musllinux wheels periodically as the awscrt version updated.

## Installation

```
pip install awscrt -f https://qqaatw.github.io/aws-crt-python-musllinux/
```
